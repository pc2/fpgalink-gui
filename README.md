# TODOs
* srun: found predefined topology (ring, etc.), ignoring explicitly given links
* delete has issues if node has self-links
* svg export computes wrong size when bounding box is a connection.
* nodes are smaller after undo/redo

# PLANNED FEATURES
* collapse
* concept to colorize links to have a better overview
  * "random" where useful 
  * defined schemes for specific topologies.
* generate directly the image from ?import argument
* write actual documentation how to use the tool
* generate topology from predefined set
  * e.g. ring; then ask for number of nodes
